## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

- The mobile and desktop version of the design are in JPG static format, meaning best judgment is required for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.
- Optimized assets are provided in the `/images` folder.
- There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information such as color palette and fonts.

### User Stories:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See all testimonials in a horizontal slider
- Receive an error message when the newsletter sign up `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## Technologies

- Javascript, SCSS, BEM, Flexbox, NPM, [Swiper.js](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper), [Perfect Pixel](https://www.welldonecode.com/perfectpixel)
